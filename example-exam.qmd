## Part 3: Code Analysis {{pts:25}}

Consider the following Python function:

```python
def mystery(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = mystery(arr[:mid])
    right = mystery(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)
```

1. {{pts:5}} What sorting algorithm does this implement?

::: {.blue}
* This is a list
   * Does it render as a list?
* It should be a bulleted list, but blue!
:::

   {{lblank}}

1. {{pts:10}} What is the time complexity? [Explain your reasoning.]{.large .highlight}

{{vf}}

3. {{pts:10}} What is the space complexity?

{{vf}}

## Part 4: Implementation {{pts:25}}

Implement a function that reverses a singly linked list in-place.

[*Requirements:*\
★ Must modify in-place ([O(1) space]{.blue})\
★ Must run in O(n) time]{.small}

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

def reverse_list(head):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```
